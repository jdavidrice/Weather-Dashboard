## Usage 

This weather app can be used to find the current weather conditions and five-day forecast for any city in the world. Cities will be saved in local storage, so when the user reloads the page, the last city searched for will be displayed. The current weather conditions section includes a color-coded UV Index that is based on information from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sunsafety/uv-index-scale-0). Cities are also saved as buttons in the "Change Location" section, and will allow the user to search again. The app is optimized for dark mode and is responsive to screen size.
